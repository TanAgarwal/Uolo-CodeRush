## About The Project

Have you ever wondered that how important and crucial your General Knowledge and luck can be? In this game not only your GK but your luck will also be tested. This is a single player 2D digital board game in which there will be certain steps from 1 to 100. And initially you will start from 1 and have to reach 100. But your luck decides what number will turn up on dice and your GK will decide how many steps you will actually take forward. Suppose your dice shows 6, then you will be asked 6 questions, and number of questions you have answered correctly will be the number of steps you will take forward. But if three consecutive times after throwing the dice, you are unable to take even a single step, then you will loose. And each question will be a timed question. It contains certain wormholes on few steps. So, if you dare to step on them, you will end on different step of the game, it can be above your current position and can be below your current position.
